  description: "Intelligent speech analysis (ISA) constitutes a significant component\
    \ within the realm of computer audition (CA) technology. \nSpeech, as a fundamental\
    \ tool for human communication, not only conveys rich semantic information but\
    \ also holds significant potential for \nvarious healthcare applications. Computational\
    \ paralinguistics methods can be used to analyse alterations in the acoustic characteristics\
    \ \nof speech signals induced by medical conditions, providing valuable insights\
    \ into shifts in an individual\u2019s health status. More importantly, \ncompared\
    \ to other physiological monitoring devices, speech acquisition devices are non-invasive\
    \ and user-friendly, making them accessible for a \nwide range of individuals.\
    \ However, despite its promise, ISA in healthcare currently faces a range of notable\
    \ challenges that hinder its \nwidespread adoption. In this survey, we present\
    \ an overview of the development and current research in speech analysis technologies\
    \ within \nthe healthcare domain. First, we summarise the methodologies employed\
    \ in ISA-based healthcare. Next, we provide an overview of applications \nin evaluating\
    \ physical diseases, mental health conditions, and neurological disorders. Additionally,\
    \ we discuss key limitations and shortcomings \nin the current state of the field.\
    \ Finally, we conclude with a summary of the discussed works and offer insights\
    \ into future research directions \naimed at addressing these limitations to advance\
    \ the practical implementation of ISA in clinical settings. This survey aims to\
    \ serve as a valuable \nresource for researchers in speech analysis, biomedicine,\
    \ and related fields. We hope to inspire greater interest in this promising area\
    \ within \nthe scientific community and provide guidance for future studies in\
    \ this evolving field.\n"

  description: "Federated learning (FL) has gained prominence in EEG-based emotion\
    \ recognition due to its ability to enable secure collaborative training without\
    \ centralized data. \nHowever, traditional FL faces challenges due to model and\
    \ data heterogeneity in smart healthcare settings. \nFor example, medical institutions\
    \ have varying computational resources, which creates a need for personalized\
    \ local models. \nMoreover, EEG data from medical institutions typically face\
    \ data heterogeneity issues stemming from limitations in participant availability,\
    \ ethical constraints, and cultural differences among subjects, which can slow\
    \ model convergence and degrade model performance. \nTo address these challenges,\
    \ we propose FedKDC, a novel FL framework that incorporates clustered knowledge\
    \ distillation (CKD). \nThis method introduces a consensus-based distributed learning\
    \ mechanism to facilitate the clustering process. \nIt then enhances the convergence\
    \ speed through intraclass distillation and reduces the negative impact of heterogeneity\
    \ through interclass distillation. \nAdditionally, we introduce a DriftGuard mechanism\
    \ to mitigate client drift, along with an entropy reducer to decrease the entropy\
    \ of aggregated knowledge. \nThe framework is validated on the SEED, SEED-IV,\
    \ SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenarios\
    \ where both the data and the models are heterogeneous. \nExperimental results\
    \ show that FedKDC outperforms other FL frameworks in emotion recognition, achieving\
    \ a maximum average accuracy of 85.2%, and in convergence efficiency, with faster\
    \ and more stable convergence. \nOur code is made publicly available at: https://github.com/wdqdp/FedKDC.\n"

  description: "Cardiovascular diseases are a prominent cause of mortality, emphasizing\
    \ the need for early prevention and diagnosis. Utilizing artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) models, heart sound analysis emerges as a noninvasive and universally applicable\
    \ approach for assessing cardiovascular health conditions. \nHowever, real-world\
    \ medical data are dispersed across medical institutions, forming \u201Cdata islands\u201D\
    \ due to data sharing limitations for security reasons. \nTo this end, federated\
    \ learning (FL) has been extensively employed in the medical field, which can\
    \ effectively model across multiple institutions. \nAdditionally, conventional\
    \ supervised classification methods require fully labeled data classes, e.g.,\
    \ binary classification requires labeling of positive and negative samples. \n\
    Nevertheless, the process of labeling healthcare data is time-consuming and labor-intensive,\
    \ leading to the possibility of mislabeling negative samples. \nIn this study,\
    \ we validate an FL framework with a naive positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy.\
    \ Semisupervised FL model can directly learn from a limited set of positive samples\
    \ and an extensive pool of unlabeled samples. \nOur emphasis is on vertical-FL\
    \ to enhance collaboration across institutions with different medical record feature\
    \ spaces. \nAdditionally, our contribution extends to feature importance analysis,\
    \ where we explore 6 methods and provide practical recommendations for detecting\
    \ abnormal heart sounds. \nThe study demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 84%,\
    \ comparable to outcomes in supervised learning, thereby advancing the application\
    \ of FL in abnormal heart sound detection.\n"

  description: "Ubiquitous sensing has been widely applied in smart healthcare, providing\
    \ an opportunity for intelligent heart sound auscultation. \nHowever, smart devices\
    \ contain sensitive information, raising user privacy concerns. \nTo this end,\
    \ federated learning (FL) has been adopted as an effective solution, enabling\
    \ decentralised learning without data sharing, thus preserving data privacy in\
    \ the Internet of Health Things (IoHT). \nNevertheless, traditional FL requires\
    \ the same architectural models to be trained across local clients and global\
    \ servers, leading to a lack of model heterogeneity and client personalisation.\
    \ \nFor medical institutions with private data clients, this study proposes Fed-MStacking,\
    \ a heterogeneous FL framework that incorporates a stacking ensemble learning\
    \ strategy to support clients in building their own models. \nThe secondary objective\
    \ of this study is to address scenarios involving local clients with data characterised\
    \ by inconsistent labelling. \nSpecifically, the local client contains only one\
    \ case type, and the data cannot be shared within or outside the institution.\
    \ \nTo train a global multi-class classifier, we aggregate missing class information\
    \ from all clients at each institution and build meta-data, which then participates\
    \ in FL training via a meta-learner. \nWe apply the proposed framework to a multi-institutional\
    \ heart sound database. The experiments utilise random forests (RFs), feedforward\
    \ neural networks (FNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as base classifiers.\
    \ \nThe results show that the heterogeneous stacking of local models performs\
    \ better compared to homogeneous stacking.\n"

  description: "Objective: Early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is a crucial\
    \ task in medical practice. \nWith the application of computer audition in the\
    \ healthcare field, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to clinical\
    \ non-invasive intelligent auscultation of heart sounds to provide rapid and effective\
    \ pre-screening. \nHowever, AI models generally require large amounts of data\
    \ which may cause privacy issues. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect large\
    \ amounts of healthcare data from a single centre. \nMethods: In this study, we\
    \ propose federated learning (FL) optimisation strategies for the practical application\
    \ in multi-centre institutional heart sound databases. \nThe horizontal FL is\
    \ mainly employed to tackle the privacy problem by aligning the feature spaces\
    \ of FL participating institutions without information leakage. \nIn addition,\
    \ techniques based on deep learning have poor interpretability due to their \u201C\
    black-box\u201D property, which limits the feasibility of AI in real medical data.\
    \ \nTo this end, vertical FL is utilised to address the issues of model interpretability\
    \ and data scarcity. \nConclusion: Experimental results demonstrate that, the\
    \ proposed FL framework can achieve good performance for heart sound abnormality\
    \ detection by taking the personal privacy protection into account. \nMoreover,\
    \ using the federated feature space is beneficial to balance the interpretability\
    \ of the vertical FL and the privacy of the data. \nSignificance: This work realises\
    \ the potential of FL from research to clinical practice, and is expected to have\
    \ extensive application in the federated smart medical system.\n"
